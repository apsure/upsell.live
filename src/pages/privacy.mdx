# Apsure Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy describes how your and your customers' personal information is collected, used, and shared when you subscribe to the
Upsell Live Shopify app (the “App”).

## PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOU

When you install the App, we collect and store your store's name, URL and your contact email address.

The App makes use of the following permissions from your Shopify store:

* **Read Products** - for choosing products to include as upsells
* **Read Orders** - for tracking items that are purchased through the upsell
* **Read and Write Themes** and **Write Script Tags** - for deploying scripts necessary for operation

These permissions are explicitly asked for and approved when the App is installed. If additional permissions are needed by the App in the future,
you will be prompted for approval for the new permissions when trying to access the App.

When you visit the App, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser,
IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device.

We collect Device Information using the following technologies:

- “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about
  cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit https://www.allaboutcookies.org<LinkExternal className="icon-inline"/>.
- “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider,
  referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.

When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Personal Information.

## PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM YOUR CUSTOMERS

When customers interact with an upsell initiated through the App, a “beacon” is sent to our servers to track such action. The beacon contains
information about their cart identifier and the action they take.

When customers complete an order, a copy of the order is sent to us to track any sales that may have been triggered from the upsell.
Only anonymized information regarding the sale of an upsell is stored.

When interacting with the upsells as a modal, the App may place a Cookie on the user's browser to prevent the modal from being shown again.

## HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?

We may use your contact email address to send you information regarding the App.

We use the Device Information that we collect to help us improve and optimize our App (for example, to aid in debugging errors).

## SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

We do not as a rule share your information with any other entity. However, we may share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations,
to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.

## DO NOT TRACK
Please note that we do not alter our App’s data collection and use practices when we see a Do Not Track signal from your browser.

## YOUR RIGHTS

If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal information we hold about you and your customers and to ask that this
information be corrected, updated, or deleted. See
[Processing GDPR data requests](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/your-account/privacy/GDPR/processing-gdpr-data-requests)<LinkExternal className="icon-inline"/>
for more information on how to initiate these requests.

Additionally, if you are a European resident we note that we are processing your information in order to fulfill contracts we might have with you,
or otherwise to pursue our legitimate business interests listed above.  Additionally, please note that your information will be transferred outside
of Europe, including to Canada and the United States.

## DATA RETENTION
When customers place an order for an upsell item through the App, we keep the tracking information until the upsell is removed or the App is
uninstalled.

If the App is uninstalled from your store, we will retain the information for up to 60 days until it is irrevocably destroyed.

## CHANGES

We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or
regulatory reasons.
