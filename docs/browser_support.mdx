The Upsell Live app consists of two parts, the administrative interface, and the portion of the app that your customers interact with.

## Admin Interface
The administrative interface supports all browsers that the Shopify admin supports. See
[Shopify's list of supported browsers](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/shopify-admin/supported-browsers)<LinkExternal className="icon-inline"/>
for the current list.

## Customer Interface

We try to be inclusive with regard to your customers to gain the largest number of buyers. Below is the list of browsers that the app
is guaranteed to work on.

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Apple Safari
- Microsoft Edge
- Internet Explorer 11 [(see note)](#limited-internet-explorer-support)
- Opera
- Apple Safari for iOS
- Google Chrome for Android

### Limited Internet Explorer Support

While we guarantee that the app will be functional in IE 11, it may not render the same as with other browsers. Text may be off-center,
and styles may be different. In general, we find that less than 0.2% of customers are using IE 11, and this proportion is going down
as time goes on.

The app is not tested on Internet Explorer 10 and below, and no guarantees can be made about its functionality.
