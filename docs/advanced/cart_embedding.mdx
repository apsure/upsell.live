By default, upsells appear as a popup when customers enter the shopping cart page. This requires no additional modifications to your theme
other than what *Upsell Live* [automatically deploys](deploying_upsells).

One feature that sets *Upsell Live* apart from other upsell apps is the ability to embed the upsells directly within your cart page.
This has a couple of advantages over the modal:

  1. It doesn't interrupt your customer's shopping flow, and
  2. The upsells are always visible on the shopping cart page.

But, since every theme's shopping cart is different, we can't embed this automatically.
You need to add a snippet of HTML to your cart's Liquid template exactly where you want it to render.

<div class="clearfix"></div>

:::note
Embedding upsells requires editing of your shopping cart's Liquid template.

## The code

The code you'll need to insert within your cart is simple:
```html
<div id="cart-upsell"></div>
```
When *Upsell Live* is ready to display the upsells, it looks for this `<div>` element, and
renders the upsells within that element if it exists.

The next question is where to put this code, which will depend on your site's theme.

 * [Sites with a cart drawer or modal](#sites-with-a-cart-drawer-or-modal)

### Sites with a cart page

<Screenshot alt="Cart page showing a potential upsell location" src="cart-without-upsell.png" alignright/>

If you use a dedicated page for the shopping cart, chances are good the Liquid template is either `templates/cart.liquid` or `sections/cart-template.liquid`.

For many themes, there is a blank section in the lower left section of the shopping cart page that works well for displaying upsells.
If the theme supports cart notes and it is enabled, they may be placed here, otherwise it is empty.

We're going to use Shopify's Venture theme as an example here. Your site's theme may be similar or it may be wildly different.

```liquid title="/sections/cart-template.liquid, lines 85-92"
<div class="grid cart__row">
  {% if section.settings.cart_notes_enable %}
    <div class="grid__item medium-up--one-half">
      <label for="CartSpecialInstructions">{{ 'cart.general.note' | t }}</label>
      <textarea name="note" id="CartSpecialInstructions" class="cart__note">{{ cart.note }}</textarea>
    </div>
  {% endif %}
  <div class="grid__item cart__buttons text-right small--text-center{% if section.settings.cart_notes_enable %} medium-up--one-half{% endif %}">
```

If you already have Cart Notes enabled, this is as simple as inserting the code right before the note instructions:
```liquid {4} title="/sections/cart-template.liquid, lines 85-93"
<div class="grid cart__row">
  {% if section.settings.cart_notes_enable %}
    <div class="grid__item medium-up--one-half">
      <div id="cart-upsell"></div>
      <label for="CartSpecialInstructions">{{ 'cart.general.note' | t }}</label>
      <textarea name="note" id="CartSpecialInstructions" class="cart__note">{{ cart.note }}</textarea>
    </div>
  {% endif %}
  <div class="grid__item cart__buttons text-right small--text-center{% if section.settings.cart_notes_enable %} medium-up--one-half{% endif %}">
```
However, if you aren't using Cart Notes, you have to make additional changes so the `<div>` elements with the `medium-up--one-half` classes get rendered anyway.
```liquid {2-4,7-9} title="/sections/cart-template.liquid, lines 85-93"
<div class="grid cart__row">
  <div class="grid__item medium-up--one-half">
    <div id="cart-upsell"></div>
    {% if section.settings.cart_notes_enable %}
      <label for="CartSpecialInstructions">{{ 'cart.general.note' | t }}</label>
      <textarea name="note" id="CartSpecialInstructions" class="cart__note">{{ cart.note }}</textarea>
    {% endif %}
  </div>
  <div class="grid__item cart__buttons text-right small--text-center medium-up--one-half">
```
:::tip
You aren't required to put the upsells here -- you could place them at the top or bottom of the cart, or anywhere inbetween.
The above example is just the most common place to insert them.

### Sites with a cart drawer or modal

:::warning
Because inlining doesn't always work with cart drawers or modals, this feature is not supported by Apsure.
Knowledge of HTML, CSS, Liquid, and Javascript may be required to correctly implement.
Consider

<Screenshot alt="Example of a cart drawer with inline upsells" src="sidebar-cart-with-inline-upsells.png" alignright />

If your website uses a cart that loads on every page, you'll need to locate the code that renders the drawer or modal.

There is no standard as to the template name used here, so you'll need to search through your theme's templates to find it.
Here are some examples:

<dl>
  <dt>Express</dt>
  <dd><code>snippets/cart-drawer.liquid</code></dd>

  <dt>Boundless</dt>
  <dd><code>layout/theme.liquid</code></dd>

  <dt>Brooklyn</dt>
  <dd><code>snippets/ajax-cart-template</code></dd>
</dl>

Once you've located the template, the process is similar to [the instructions for sites with a cart page](#sites-with-a-cart-page).
There may be some additional steps required to get it right.
