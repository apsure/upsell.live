Upsell Live gives you a flexible way to highlight additional items for sale in the shopping
cart just prior to checkout. It's a great way to get additional exposure for items you want to
sell.

By default, the upsells are displayed in a popup dialog when the customer clicks the "Checkout" button
from the shopping cart, but you can opt to display them as soon as they reach the shopping cart.
There is also a way to [embed upsells directly into the shopping cart](advanced/cart_embedding)
for a more seamless experience.
