Upsell Live gives you a flexible way to highlight additional items for sale in the shopping
cart just prior to checkout. It's a great way to get additional exposure for items you want to
sell.

By default, the upsells are displayed in a popup dialog when the customer reaches the cart page,
but there are guides to [embed upsells directly into the shopping cart](advanced/cart_embedding)
for a more seamless experience.
